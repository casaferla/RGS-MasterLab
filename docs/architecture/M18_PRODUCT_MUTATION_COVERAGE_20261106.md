# M18 — Product Mutation Coverage & Macro-Lot Admission Contract
Date: 2026-11-06
Status: PREPRODUCTION AUDIT, not merged, not FQ, not product activation.
Baseline: Focused #1052 Windows/Linux SUCCESS at 7b80452ec414cd3d5d781cd61d9a434420efa8aa.

## Purpose
The independent M18EpochCommitBarrier is useful but alone UNSAFE as authorization to publish a file from a background worker. It must be connected to all authoritative changes that could make an M17 Master, selected Output-Rate, source identity or consent stale. This checklist is an admission gate for the NEXT coherent macrolot; it is not evidence those changes have been implemented.

## Existing paths requiring explicit review / coverage
1. app/src/terminal_private_product_session.cpp::request_private_impl — starts a fresh Pending and calls renderer_->request_private(rate), superseding previous M17 assumptions; enforce epoch transition before any observable pending/renderer publication.
2. app/src/terminal_private_product_session.cpp::cancel — withdraws pending/master and calls publisher_->revoke_private and renderer_->invalidate. This can invalidate the owner while an M18 worker is encoding. A commit-held lease MUST deny/defer the invalidation before the first destructive operation. The UI must display BUSY without blocking the event loop.
3. app/src/terminal_private_product_session.cpp::cancel_pending_on_region_change — SOURCE-region signals call cancel synchronously; the lease must make that path fail/queue instead of silently revoking an active export.
4. app/src/terminal_private_product_session.cpp::failed and stale — both may clear Pending; their renderer-driven/error recovery branches must not retire an actively committed owner before readback.
5. app/src/terminal_private_product_session.cpp::on_renderer_changed — ERROR/STALE/MEASURED/READY transitions can invoke failed/stale/renderer invalidate/installs. Audit signal reentrancy, and ensure no callback bypasses the busy commit guard.
6. app/src/terminal_private_product_session.cpp::return_private_monitor_to_manual and retry_source_return_after_monitor_retirement — SOURCE/manual owner may be reinstalled, renderer invalidated and Pending cleared during monitor recovery. All transitions must respect held export owner identity without breaking existing M17 physical return guarantees.
7. app/src/terminal_private_product_session.cpp::install_measured_private / install_accepted_candidate, suspend_for_comparison / resume_comparison — potential stage and audible identity changes. Distinguish nonconforming measured PCM (never an authorized M18 source) from checked full M17 Master.
8. app/src/terminal_private_product_session.cpp::adopt_pending_source_loop_without_rerender — SOURCE loop can change without rerendering full PCM; determine if this invalidates Product export consent / source epoch, and enforce a single policy.
9. app/src/terminal_candidate_gate.*::invalidate/accept/staged — master candidate ownership can change externally, not only via the Product session. Audit every callsite and ensure an invalidation that affects export identity participates in the same generation.
10. Project-wide Source/Project selection, output Master rate, Gold/Prepared/manual owner, chain revision and file close/delete — inspect upstream App/Project controllers and the authoritative project/session state, not just this TerminalPrivateProductSession class. Without their cooperation, barrier is NOT a real Single-Writer Epoch lock.
11. app/src/m18_private_export_authority.cpp currently constructs a synchronous Qt-owning-thread QPointer+consent callback. DO NOT transfer this callback or access to QObject to worker threads. Introduce an immutable export ticket and independently revocable, thread-safe Product-issued authority; recheck at admission and before file commit. Consent revocation must affect unpublished candidates.
12. platform/windows/src/transactional_audio_exporter.cpp::export_impl — new M18 request must keep its existing identity/no-overwrite/rollback/postcommit readback contract. The worker-held lease must span the entire commit-and-readback region. Neither M16 TP mathematics, source SHA or M18 PCM codec may be silently bypassed.

## Next true MACRO-LOT — stage several cohesive sublots, then ONE CI
A. Authoritative epoch+consent snapshot and invariant tests: capture M17's exact owner, source/project identity, rate, revisions, and explicit export intent ON the Product thread; no QObject access on a worker.
B. Mutation interlocks: route every dangerous Product and upstream project mutation through an opt-in nonblocking gate; reject/defer changes while a commit lease is active. Verify ERROR/CANCEL/REGION/RETURN/REPREPARE paths and avoid Qt event-loop waits.
C. End-to-end worker handoff with unchanged canonical Windows exporter: stale/revoked ticket rejection, collision/rollback, lease lifetime across post-commit verification, deterministic destruction/cancellation.
D. Adversarial tests: concurrent worker leases, revoke-before-commit, SOURCE switch, project switch, rate change, M17 stage replacement, owner lifetime, and repeated cancel/return signal reentrancy. Keep existing Windows and Linux M16/M17 gates green.

Promote to the Draft PR only AFTER A–D is coherent, source preflight passes, and all six M16 B2i protected Git blobs match the exact baseline. ONE exact-SHA CAS, ONE Windows+Linux Focused CI for the macro-lot. Any intermediate staging commits must be no-PR/no-CI, and do not publish an unguarded path. This does not authorize main merge, Full Qualification or user-facing GUI.

## Concurrency policy
The M18EpochCommitBarrier mutex only protects the SHORT gate transitions; never hold the mutex during DSP, I/O or a Qt callback. A held permit forces a Product mutator to respond immediately BUSY or explicitly schedule a deferred transition. If Product cannot guarantee this over ALL paths, do not activate the asynchronous exporter. A committed destination may become visible before subsequent readback fails; rollback is mandatory while the permit is still held.

## Decision log
Focused #1050 checked 48 Windows filesystem exports; #1051 checked 14 injected rollback cases; #1052 checked one nonblocking barrier primitive. Those were valid individual qualification checkpoints but small in delivery scope. Going forward batch multi-component functionality/negative tests into a single coherent preproduction macro-lot and avoid a new CI for each small test/documentation change.
